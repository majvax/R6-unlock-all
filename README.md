# ðŸ”“ R6 unlock all

This unlock-all is an exploit that allow you to use any local save file instead of yours. Allowing you to use almost any skins like "glacier". 

This project has been made to offer a free alternative to paid one[^1], as this type of program work only by spoofing your device's mac address.

I previously used [tmac](https://technitium.com/tmac/), I never got banned using it for the past two months but heard that it is unsafe now, even tho I don't think anyone will get hwid banned by doing this as long as not being too blatant (Champ charm). Anyway, I wanted to make my own spoofer so here you are.
